Setting up a Hey Duwamish API instance
======================================
Hey Duwamish requires python2.6 or greater (and PostgreSQL 9.1 and development libraries by default to build).

What's here
------------

This package contains the Shareabouts API web service,
which is a Django web application providing:

* A RESTful web service
* A management user interface, at /manage
* The basic Django admin UI, for low-level superuser tasks, at /admin

The Hey Duwamish web application JavaScript and related files are
*not* part of this package. [You'll need to install that separately](https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts/).

For more about the parts of Shareabouts,
see [the architecture documentation](ARCHITECTURE.md).

Database
--------

The Shareabouts REST API requires GeoDjango.  To install GeoDjango on your
platform, see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/install/#platform-specific-instructions.
For example, to install on Debian/Ubuntu, perform the following:

    sudo apt-get install postgresql postgis libpq-dev postgresql-9.4 postgresql-9.4-postgis-2.1 postgresql-server-dev-9.4 python-psycopg2 binutils

Note that the postgres versions may differ anywhere from 9.3 to 9.6, and postgis version may differ between 2.0 to 2.3. For example, on Ubuntu 16.04, you should be able to run this:

    sudo apt-get install postgresql postgis libpq-dev postgresql-9.5 postgresql-9.5-postgis-2.2 postgresql-server-dev-9.5 python-psycopg2 binutils libjpeg8-dev

Create a development database for the Shareabouts data store.

    sudo su postgres

For PostGIS 2.0 and up:

    createdb shareabouts_v2
    psql -U postgres -d shareabouts_v2
    # inside the postgres CLI:
    # execute the '\password' psql command for set the password for the 'postgres' user:
    \password postgres
    # Enter a db password, noting that 'postgres' is the password in our template 'src/project/local_settings.py.template'
    Enter new password: <enter your password>
    Enter it again: <enter your password again>
    CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
    \q

To enable your database settings, go to the `src` folder and create a new hidden text file called `.env` and your information:

    PASS=<enter your password here>

We have a configuration with default settings that will load automatically. If you want to override any of the default database settings, add them to the `.env` file as follows:

    USERNAME=<default is 'postgres'>
    HOST=<default is 'localhost'>
    PORT=<default is '5432'>

Then bootstrap the development database using the usual Django command:

    src/manage.py migrate

Local setup
------------

Install `pip` and `virtualenv`, if not already installed.  These will keep your
requirements isolated from the rest of your machine.

    sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential
    sudo pip install --upgrade pip
    sudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv

For older versions of ubuntu:

    sudo easy_install pip
    sudo pip install virtualenv

Create a new virtual environment inside of the repository folder, and install
the project requirements:

    virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

(May have to first address Database section above, as `pip install -r
requirements.txt` may fail looking for `pg_config`.)

NOTE: If you run in to trouble with gevent, you can safely comment it out of
the requirements.txt file.  It is not needed for local development.  To comment
it out, just add a hash to the beginning of the line for `gevent`.

To run the development server:

    src/manage.py runserver 8001

This will start the service at http://localhost:8001/ .

If you don't specify a port, the server will start on port 8000.
We recommend getting in the habit of using port 8001 so you can
work with the sa-web front end application on the same development
host, and run that one on port 8000.

NOTE: If you're new to programming with virtual environments, be sure to remember
to activate your virtual environment every time you start a new terminal session.

    source env/bin/activate

Accessing the Management UI
----------------------------

To generate an API key to connect a web app with your locally deployed API, execute the following:

    ./src/manage.py createsuperuser

Create a username and password, then access the admin panel as follows (assuming that we've deployed to localhost 8001):

    http://localhost:8001/admin

Then create a dataset and API key. We can load these into our web-app as `SITE_URL` and `SITE_KEY` variables, which will connect our front end app to the API.

Running the Shareabouts Web Application
-----------------------------------------

For local development, you will probably also want to install and run [the
front-end mapping application](https://github.com/mapseed/platform/).


Deployment
-------------

See [the deployment docs](DEPLOY.md).


Testing
--------

To run the tests, run this command:

  src/manage.py test
